# FingerTriggers

This is a project for CSC 578C - Designing Creativity Support Tools at University of Victoria, spring 2021. This goal of this project is create a glove with Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs) in the fingertips to use as MIDI triggers.

Files:
- FingerTriggers.ino is the Arduino program for detecting the FSR values. The FSRs are currently set to analog inputs A0 and A1. It transmits the data to the host computer over the serial port.
- FingerTriggers.maxpat is the Max patch for decoding the serial data and using that to trigger snare and kick synthesizers contained in the patch.

More updates will be coming soon as well as links to instructions for constructing all of the different parts.
